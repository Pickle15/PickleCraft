PickleCraft is my personal plugin.
Orginally created for Orcworm.co.uk, but has been slightly modified to be able to add "components"
these components are generally single classes and are loadable from the config.

Goal for now is begin writing an simple but easy to use api so porting shall be easy.

This plugin is operated on several small private servers including my own: mc.picklecraft.net
